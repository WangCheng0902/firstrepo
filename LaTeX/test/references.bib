  abstract = {Real carotid arteries are elastic and perfused with a non-Newtonian fluid. The blood flow is pulsatile characterized by the reverse flow regions at the non-divider wall of internal carotid artery and external carotid artery. A coupling effect between fluid flow and elastic deformation is introduced. In addition we have calculated volumetric flow rate, pressure gradient and Impedance due to pulsatile flow in elastic carotid artery. We analyzed the flow at various locations in common carotid artery and internal carotid artery for different frequencies 60, 90, 120pulse/min and Reynolds number 500 using a compliance mismatch model of carotid artery. Reverse flow of blood increases the impedance and should not be discarded. The problem has been analyzed mathematically and the agreement between present results and the available literature was found to be quite satisfactory.},
