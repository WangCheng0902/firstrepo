  abstract = {The objective of this study is to develop a model of the cardiovascular system capable of simulating the short-term ({$\leq$}5 min) transient and steady-state hemodynamic responses to head-up tilt and lower body negative pressure. The model consists of a closed-loop lumped-parameter representation of the circulation connected to set-point models of the arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflexes. Model parameters are largely based on literature values. Model verification was performed by comparing the simulation output under baseline conditions and at different levels of orthostatic stress to sets of population-averaged hemodynamic data reported in the literature. On the basis of experimental evidence, we adjusted some model parameters to simulate experimental data. Orthostatic stress simulations are not statistically different from experimental data (two-sided test of significance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons). Transient response characteristics of heart rate to tilt also compare well with reported data. A case study is presented on how the model is intended to be used in the future to investigate the effects of postspaceflight orthostatic intolerance.本研究旨在开发一种心血管系统模型，能够模拟人体对头高位倾斜和下体负压的短期（{$\leq$}5 分钟）瞬态及稳态血流动力学响应。该模型由循环系统的闭环集总参数表征构成，并与动脉及心肺压力反射的设定点模型相连接。模型参数主要基于文献报道值，通过将基线条件及不同水平直立应激下的仿真输出与文献中报告的群体平均血流动力学数据集进行对比，完成了模型验证。根据实验证据，我们调整了部分模型参数以匹配实验数据。直立应激模拟结果与实验数据无统计学差异（经 Bonferroni 多重比较校正的双侧显著性检验）。心率对倾斜的瞬态响应特性也与已报道数据高度吻合。本文还通过一个案例研究，展示了该模型未来如何用于研究航天后直立耐受不良效应。},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional mathematical model was developed to examine the transient and steady-state temperature distribution in the human brain during selective brain cooling (SBC) by unilateral intracarotid freezing-cold saline infusion. To determine the combined effect of hemodilution and hypothermia from the cold saline infusion, data from studies investigating the effect of these two parameters on cerebral blood flow (CBF) were pooled, and an analytic expression describing the combined effect of the two factors was derived. The Pennes bioheat equation used the thermal properties of the different cranial layers and the effect of cold saline infusion on CBF to propagate the evolution of brain temperature. A healthy brain and a brain with stroke (ischemic core and penumbra) were modeled. CBF and metabolic rate data were reduced to simulate the core and penumbra. Simulations using different saline flow rates were performed. The results suggested that a flow rate of 30 ml/min is sufficient to induce moderate hypothermia within 10 min in the ipsilateral hemisphere. The brain with stroke cooled to lower temperatures than the healthy brain, mainly because the stroke limited the total intracarotid blood flow. Gray matter cooled twice as fast as white matter. The continuously falling hematocrit was the main time-limiting factor, restricting the SBC to a maximum of 3 h. The study demonstrated that SBC by intracarotid saline infusion is feasible in humans and may be the fastest method of hypothermia induction.},

  abstract = {Background: We developed a hemodynamic mathematical model of human circulation coupled to a virtual hemodialyzer. The model was used to explore mechanisms underlying our clinical observations involving hemodialysis. Methods: The model consists of whole body human circulation, baroreflex feedback control, and a hemodialyzer. Four model populations encompassing baseline, dialysed, therapeutic hypothermia treated, and simultaneous dialysed with hypothermia were generated. In all populations atrial fibrillation and renal failure as co-morbidities, and exercise as a treatment were simulated. Clinically relevant measurables were used to quantify the effects of each in silico experiment. Sensitivity analysis was used to uncover the most relevant parameters. Results: Relative to baseline, the modelled dialysis increased the population mean diastolic blood pressure by 5\%, large vessel wall shear stress by 6\%, and heart rate by 20\%. Therapeutic hypothermia increased systolic blood pressure by 3\%, reduced large vessel shear stress by 15\%, and did not affect heart rate. Therapeutic hypothermia reduced wall shear stress by 15\% in the aorta and 6\% in the kidneys, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory benefit. Therapeutic hypothermia reduced cardiac output under atrial fibrillation by 12\% and under renal failure by 20\%. Therapeutic hypothermia and exercise did not affect dialyser function, but increased water removal by approximately 40\%. Conclusions: This study illuminates some mechanisms of the action of therapeutic hypothermia. It also suggests clinical measurables that may be used as surrogates to diagnose underlying diseases such as atrial fibrillation.},
